# Outputs:
# - Crvs (GH: Crvs) | list[Rhino.Geometry.Curve] | Interpolated segment curves
# - PtTree (GH: PtTree) | Grasshopper.DataTree[Rhino.Geometry.Point3d] | Points grouped by segment

GhPython: split non-continuous point sets into curve segments.

Inputs:
    Pts:    list[Rhino.Geometry.Point3d]  - all points, in order
    MaxGap: float                         - max distance allowed inside a segment

Outputs:
    Crvs:   list[Rhino.Geometry.Curve]    - one curve per continuous segment
    PtTree: Grasshopper.DataTree[Point3d] - points grouped by segment (one branch per segment)
